grafcube


Description:
------------

	3D video game and game engine forked from cube 1.


Building:
---------

	On a Unix-like system invoke `make' in the main directory.

		make

	If you are using a BSD based unix-like system then GNU make
	can be invoked as `gmake':

		gmake

	Legacy systems are not supported.

	Several development headers are required. If you are using a 
	debian or ubuntu system you can install a partial list of them 
	using:

		sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev \
			libsdl-mixer1.2-dev xorg-dev


Run the game:
-------------

	make run


Project Goals:
--------------

	Write as much of the game as possible in C.

	Remove superfluous features.

	Replace all textures with ones gathered from the field.

	Write new music for the game using mainly acoustic cello.

	Create new sound effects, weapons and MD2 objects.

	Create a new MD2 player models with an open source license.

	Remove non-free components.


When will it be done?:
----------------------

	When there is nothing left to be removed. 


Editing:
--------

	/waterlevel N	Set water level at N

	/map mapname 	Load a map

	/newmap		Create a new map

	/savemap	Save a map

	insert key	toggle flor textures

	/perlin		Generate terrain automatically


Changes:
--------

	3000 lines of compiler warnings were fixed by researching each warning 
	and adding the needed changes. No extra compiler flags are used to 
	suppress these warnings.

	A method for translating and moving code out of the game and into a 
	seperate C library was established. This code is located under 
	src/c-game/ and over 1000 lines have already been translated to C. 

	Multiplayer networking was removed. This is not ideal. However it
	dropped nearly 1000 lines of code and helped to narrow the game down to
	its initial intended implementation of a single player game.  Bear in 
	mind that src versions of cube contain altered networking code so they
	can't run against the original master server and that new forks would 
	have limited numbers of players.


MODEL EDITING:
--------------

	A free ware version of the Quake MD@ player model editor is included
	with grafcube. This program needs to be ran in the WINE windows
	emulator. It would be nice to replace this with a source code version
	of Blender3D or mmd3 that would run and compile natively on linux or


		wine model-editor/MDL.EXE packages/models/monster/hellpig/tris.md2

	You will need to have the WINE windows emulator installed. If you are
	using a debian or ubuntu based distro it can be installed with:

		sudo apt-get install wine

	To edit the model wire frame click the tab labeled "C" and then click
	"build face". At this point you should be able to click and drag to
	modify the player model.
